What’s the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of HomeSense?
Here’s the simplest version of your thesis system that proves your idea:

✅ 1. Smart Plug Integration
Fetch real-time power usage from at least one device

Display its current consumption (e.g., watts)

✅ 2. Usage Logging
Save timestamped usage to a database (e.g., MongoDB or local file)

✅ 3. Bill Prediction
Simple linear regression that estimates monthly bill based on usage trends

✅ 4. Basic Web UI or Console Output
Display:

Appliance name

Daily/weekly usage

Estimated cost

Simple graph or list

Optional but nice:
Button to turn the device on/off

Notification if the device exceeds a daily budget
